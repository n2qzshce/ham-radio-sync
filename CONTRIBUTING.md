# Contribution guidelines

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! Pull requests may be submitted by anyone.
In order to keep the code maintainable, the following guidelines are in place.

### Code style
* Indentations use tabs, variables use `snake_case`, classes use `CamelCase`.
* When possible, functionality should be packaged in classes or methods in a 
unit-testable manner.
* Line endings are CRLF.
* Implementations of classes should have methods in the same order.
* Use f-strings and single quoted strings where possible.

### Required development software
* Python 3.8
* pip3

### Features and functionality
* Please discuss any new features or changes you'd like to make with the
repository owner(s) before submitting your pull request: we're excited to
hear about your ideas!
* All new functionality needs unit tests to exercise its behavior, where
pragmatic. This helps minimize regression issues and shows how code runs.
